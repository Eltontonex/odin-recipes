# odin-recipes

My name is Elton so ummm today iam going to start my project on the 9th of June 2025. Currently iam 19 years now and its been like three weeks since i 
started computer science lessons and its going pretty good than i imagined. At first i thought dammnnn this is the end of my life but no its not i was lying
to myself things are going so smooth right now  i dont know when i start doing data bases and algorithms. I now know how to create a repository on github and edit the README.md file. Yess i know what you're thinking and saying
but little things matter right. Also i can create a website too but i cant design it but soon i will its just a matter of time cz i will be jumping into
CSS lessons next week so soon i will be a web developer. So okay i dont wanna waste much time i wanna tell y'all what iam doing today.

So today iam going to make my first website as my project. The project will be display recipes that iam tryna give you so that u can try out and find out
how delicious and sumptous they are.
